# MathQuizGame
I designed Math Quiz Game app using MIT App Inventor. It allows users to log in, answer random math questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication), view scores, filter results, delete entries, and check average time. The app helps students practice math and allows teachers and parents to track progress. In this way, more students can use this app to relieve as it is one of the method that keep math as a fun subject to learn.
